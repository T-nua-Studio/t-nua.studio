# GitHub Pages Fix: Jekyll Disabled

## Problem Fixed
GitHub Pages was trying to build your site with Jekyll (static site generator), but your site is pure HTML/CSS/JS. This caused build conflicts and cancellations.

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ **Created `.nojekyll` file** - tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing
2. ✅ **Fixed CNAME** - corrected domain to `www.t-nua.studio`

## How It Works
- `.nojekyll` file (empty) = GitHub serves your HTML files directly
- No more Jekyll build process = no more build cancellations
- Faster deployments = instant updates

## Deployment Status
After the next push, your site should deploy successfully without Jekyll interference.

## Verify Deployment
1. Push these changes: `npm run deploy`
2. Wait 2-3 minutes (much faster now)
3. Check: https://www.t-nua.studio

The site will now deploy as a pure static site without Jekyll processing.
