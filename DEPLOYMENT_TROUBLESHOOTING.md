# GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

## Problem Analysis
Your deployment errors show multiple builds canceling each other, caused by:
1. **Rapid CNAME file changes** (created/deleted multiple times)
2. **Quick successive commits** triggering overlapping builds
3. **No build waiting/throttling**

## Solutions

### 1. Immediate Fix - Stable Deployment
Wait 5-10 minutes after the last commit before pushing again to let pending builds complete.

### 2. Better Deployment Workflow
Use the new npm scripts:

```powershell
# Safe deployment with review step
npm run deploy:safe

# Or direct deployment (improved with language check)
npm run deploy
```

### 3. Manual GitHub Pages Settings Check
1. Go to your repo: https://github.com/T-nua-Studio/www.t-nua.studio
2. Settings → Pages
3. Ensure:
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "main" 
   - Folder: "/ (root)"
   - Custom domain: "www.t-nua.studio" (now in CNAME file)

### 4. Deployment Best Practices
- **Batch changes**: Make multiple edits, then commit once
- **Wait between deployments**: 5+ minutes between pushes
- **Check build status**: Visit Actions tab to see build progress
- **Use deploy:safe**: Review changes before pushing

## Fixed Files
- ✅ Created stable CNAME file with your domain
- ✅ Added safer deployment scripts
- ✅ Fixed package.json structure

## Next Steps
1. Wait 10 minutes for current builds to clear
2. Use `npm run deploy:safe` for future deployments
3. Check https://www.t-nua.studio in ~5 minutes after deployment

The site should deploy successfully now with the stable CNAME and improved workflow.
